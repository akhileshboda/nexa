# Nexa
Nexa is a student networking platform that helps university students connect through shared courses, interests, and events. Built during **FoundersHack 2025**, Nexa aims to make university life more engaging, supportive, and community-driven.

## Inspiration  
Starting university can be overwhelming â€” from building friendships to finding academic and career support. Nexa was born to bridge this gap by creating authentic, meaningful student connections.  

## What it does  
- Connect with peers through shared **courses, interests, and goals**  
- Discover and join **events nearby**  
- Engage in authentic **conversations and communities**  

## How we built it  
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth & Database)  
- **Hosting**: Local development environment for demo purposes  
- **Collaboration**: GitHub + Trello  

## Challenges  
- Integrating authentication and event storage quickly  
- Managing scope within limited hackathon time  
- Balancing clean design with functional delivery  

## Accomplishments  
- Delivered a working MVP in under a week  
- Built a responsive, student-friendly interface  
- Received strong validation from peers during testing  

## What we learned  
- The importance of MVP scoping and prioritisation  
- Efficient collaboration under tight deadlines

## What's next for Nexa  
- Richer profiles & personalised recommendations  
- In-app messaging & community features

- Transition from local hosting to production-ready deployment
